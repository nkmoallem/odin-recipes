This is my first project of the Odin Project course; we are tasked to create three html sites for three different recipes. At this moment in time, we have learned the following basic syntax in html:

- Paragraphs
- Bold text
- Italic text
- Lists
- Images
- Lists

I aim to implement all the above skills in this project.
